What is this?

This is the first rails app I completed entirely on my own. Truth be told this project had (and into the future will continue to have) a much deeper meaning to me.  

Born out of my work and disappointment with many of New York’s veteran based non-for-profits, in 2015 I co-founded Pathfinder Labs LLC.  Our mission was to build a web platform focused on aggregating reviews of veteran resources for veterans, military families, volunteers and donors to help them make informed decisions about services, and where best to allocate resources, while making providers socially accountable.  

During this project, while I wore many hats and learned a wide variety of skills, I could not have told you what python was (our main language), let alone that it even was a coding language. This lack of knowledge is what first pointed me in the direction of coding. 

So half way through Code Platoon, I began my effort to try and recreate Pathfinder as a simple rails app with my new coding knowledge. It’s not the most impressive piece of work, with bells and whistles. Its a personal thing, something I had to do strictly for myself. Although it will never make a dime, I am very proud of it so far, and it made me feel accomplished as a programmer for the first time.
